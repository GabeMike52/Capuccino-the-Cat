        <h2>Capo's information</h2>
        <p>Capo is a siamese breed, so he likes to purr, meow, and tries to communicate, especially if food is on the matter. He left his mom when he was a bit less than a month old.</p>
        <p>Capo had a sister, Luna, she was a feral cat and couldn't make into knowing him better. She went to another house to live as a lone cat. Capo was really afraid of Luna, she would hiss at him and try to pounce him, he knew he couldn't take her in a fight.</p>
        <p>Capo loves to cuddle, when I'm working, Capo comes to my lap and starts to purr and lick himself. He is a playful kitten, he loves to play hunt with his toys and to jump like a bunny.</p>
